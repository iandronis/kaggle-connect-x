# Connect X (Kaggle competition)

With this repo, I take part for the Kaggle competition called [Connect X].

## What is Connect X?

Connect X is a simple two players board game. Each player has one color of
checkers and in front of them they have a board of #number_of_columns and
#number_of_rows.
In each turn, the player throws a checker and his/her goal is to form a line
with them (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) . The length of this line would
be X, hence the name of "Connect X". So for example, in [Connect 4] you must
form a line of 4 checkers.

## Repo's goal

With this project, I'll try implementing some Machine Learning techniques,
evaluate those solutions and see my place in the competition's leaderboard.
